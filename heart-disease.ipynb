    "\n",
    "1. Getting the data ready: So, to summarize, the data is to be prepared for the machine learning algorithm. It differs from dataset to dataset on how the data is to be prepared. For example, some datasets do not have missing values in the columns, whereas some do. Where there are missing values, it is addressed by either removing the rows with missing values or doing imputation, where a theoretical data is substituted in. But if a dataset does not have missing values, the step to address missing values are not done. It is also checked if the dataset is balanced or not here in this step. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Choose the right estimator/algorithm for our problems: This is done by experimentation, to know which models are best for a problem. It cannot be known beforehand, however, some key factor is to choose a classification model for a classification problem, and to choose a regression model for a regression problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Fit the model/algorithm and use it to make predictions on our data: The model is trained on a portion of data from the dataset. It is important to use different data for training and testing, so the data is split usually its done to be 80-20. A student practices and learns through a few question sets, but the student gets graded on a different question set. The same applies to machine learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Evaluating a model: After training the model, the model gets evaluated to see how well they performed. There are various performance metrics such as accuracy, precision etc, which will be explained later. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Improve a model: The model gets experimented by tuning different hyperparameters of the model. The hyperparameters that the model performed the best on, is kept. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Save and load a trained model: In order to implement the model onto an application, the model saved such as by pickle format, and is imported onto the application's code to make predictions. But in this case, this step is skipped since the model is not being imported to an application.\n",
