    "Steps to train machine learning model workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Getting the data ready: So, to summarize, the data is to be prepared for the machine learning algorithm. It differs from dataset to dataset on how the data is to be prepared. For example, some datasets do not have missing values in the columns, whereas some do. Where there are missing values, it is addressed by either removing the rows with missing values or doing imputation, where a theoretical data is substituted in. But if a dataset does not have missing values, the step to address missing values are not done. It is also checked if the dataset is balanced or not here in this step. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Choose the right estimator/algorithm for our problems: This is done by experimentation, to know which models are best for a problem. It cannot be known beforehand, however, some key factors are to choose a classification model for a classification problem, and to choose a regression model for a regression problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Fit the model/algorithm and use it to make predictions on our data: The model is trained on a portion of data from the dataset. It is important to use different data for training and testing, so the data is split usually its done to be 80-20. A student practices and learns through a few question sets, but the student gets graded on a different question set. The same applies to machine learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Evaluating a model: After training the model, the model gets evaluated to see how well they performed. There are various performance metrics such as accuracy, precision etc, which will be explained later. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Improve a model: The model gets experimented by tuning different hyperparameters of the model. The hyperparameters that the model performed the best on, is kept. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Save and load a trained model: In order to implement the model onto an application, the model saved such as by pickle format, and is imported onto the application's code to make predictions. But in this case, this step is skipped since the model is not being imported to an application.\n",

    "# Confirmed: Best model is Ridge.\n",
    "From the confusion matrix, and classification report, it can be observed that it does not have any side effects of the model. The side effects depend on the requirements. For example, if the side effect is that the model produces too many false positives, but the requirements mention it should not. \n",
    "# Improving the model using hyperparameter tuning.\n",
    "Finally, lets test out different parameters on the model, and carry on futher with the best settings on the model. This is done using GridSearchCV. \n",
    "\n",
    "The ways to improve the model are:\n",
    "1. Feature engineering: involves creates new features or transforming existing features that represents underlying data better. This can include techniques such as one-hot encoding, feature scaling, dimensionality reduction, or creating interaction variables.\n",
    "2. Hyperparameter tuning: Hyperparameters are the settings or configurations of a machine learning algorithm that are not learned from the data. Optimizing the hyperparameters can significantly improve model performance. Techniques like grid search, random search etc. Grid search cv and random search cv have been explained like so:\n",
    "    - Grid Search CV: Grid Search CV  is a technique that exhaustively searches through a predefined grid of hyperparameter combinations to determine the best set of hyperparameters for a given machine learning algorithm. It works by evaluating the performance of the model on each combination of hyperparameters using cross-validation. This can be computationally expensive but due to it exhaustively searching for parameters, it can sometimes be better than Random Search CV.\n",
    "    - Random Search CV: Random Search CV is an alternative technique that randomly samples hyperparameter combinations from a predefined distribution or range of values. Unlike Grid Search CV, Random Search CV does not explore all possible combinations. Instead, it focuses on sampling a fixed number of random combinations. This can be lesser time-consuming and lesser computationally expensive than Grid Search CV because it does not ehaustively search for parameters.\n",
    "3. Cross-validation: Cross-validation is a technique used to evaluate model performance by splitting the data into multiple subsets and training/evaluating the model on different combinations of these subsets. It helps to estimate how well the model will generalize to unseen data and prevents overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hyperparameter tuning is done with Grid Search CV here. Hyperparameter tuning could have been done by hand, or grid search cv or random search cv. The reason why grid search cv was done here is because it does not take long to train the model, so exhaustively searching for best parameters to optimize the model is a good tradeoff compared to having random search cv which is less computationally expensive. The reason why hyperparameter tuning was not done by hand is because grid search cv helps to explore more options for hyperparameters with less code. "

    "So, to summarize first the data was prepared for machine learning from the dataset, and there are various steps that can be performed to do this, depending on the dataset as has been explained. Then the data is split to x and y to separate the input and output data. Then the categorical columns are transformed because machines understand numerical data better than categorical columns. \n",

    "\n",
    "Then, 6 models are trained and observed how they perform using average accuracies by retraining each model 5 times. It has been retrained for 5 times because models are initialized with random hyperparameters automatically, and these hyperparameters are optimized during training. Due to this randomization being present, it may give different results. That's why average is taken to reduce that impact. More evaluations are done later to understand all the other metrics to see where the model performs poorly. Then the best model is chosen, which is Ridge in this case.\n",
